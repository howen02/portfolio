                        I'm currently in my second year pursuing a Bachelor's
                        degree in Computer Science at the National University of
                        Singapore. Furthermore, I'm actively engaged in
                        exploring Artificial Intelligence and their real-world
                        applications, as well as delving into the principles of
                        software engineering to design robust and scalable
                        software systems.

                        <br />
                        With a keen interest in frontend development, I aim to
                        design user interfaces that are visually appealing and
                        easy to navigate, ensuring an excellent user experience.
                        I continually refine my skills and keep up with industry
                        trends to create seamless and engaging digital
                        interactions. Through my dedication to mastering UI/UX
                        design, I strive to have a meaningful impact on
                        enhancing user satisfaction and usability in the digital
                        sphere.

                        Moreover, you can often find me delving into Web3
                        technologies, particularly exploring Decentralized
                        Finance (DeFi) protocols and their potential
                        applications. Here are some of the NFTs (Non-fungible
                        tokens) I've collected so far! üëáüèª
