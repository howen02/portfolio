                        I'm currently in my second year pursuing a Bachelor's
                        degree in Computer Science at the esteemed National
                        University of Singapore, where I am immersing myself in
                        the ever-evolving world of technology.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        With a keen interest in frontend development, I aim to
                        design user interfaces that are visually appealing and
                        easy to navigate, ensuring an excellent user experience.
                        I continually refine my skills and stay abreast of
                        industry trends to create seamless and engaging digital
                        interactions. Through my dedication to mastering UI/UX
                        design, I strive to have a meaningful impact on
                        enhancing user satisfaction and usability in the digital
                        sphere.

                        Moreover, you can often find me delving into Web3
                        technologies, particularly exploring decentralized
                        finance (DeFi) protocols and their potential
                        applications. Below are some of the NFTs (Non-fungible
                        tokens) I've collected so far üëáüèª
